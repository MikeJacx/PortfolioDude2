        <p>I am a Chicago based designer who has been designing for more than 7 years on multiple mediums. I first started designing as a way to make money around the age of 14 while also being involved in one of my favorite gaming communities. This is where I would get all my commissions. Since then I have ventured into several forms of Design. If you catch me enjoying myself away from work you'd most likely see me at a basketball gym playing my favorite sport.</p>
