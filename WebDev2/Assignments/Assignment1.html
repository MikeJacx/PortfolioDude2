        Just off on the reading, I can agree with the fact that they have so much influence over the world. One thing I can think of when thinking of the influence that the web has is the influence of social media. Social Media has inspired clothing changes and many more things. There was not much mention of social media in the reading, but there are tons of businesses being handled on social media and lots of changes in society come from social media. Many of the social media around also have tons of influence on consumers. For example, the rise of dopamine from the likes we get really affects the way people act on social media. Everyone wants to be the next something. We see this on Google and Facebook’s other products Instagram (Facebook), and YouTube (Google). Social Media can bring tons of change to people’s lives, and we see that from the YouTubers that give back like Mr. Beast who just recently just gave 1000 free surgeries to blind people to help them see. There are tons of people everywhere making videos trying to be the next huge content creator because it is what they love but there is a lot of money behind it too. It is social media in anything you can think of too because there is a market for it. Live streaming does not just happen on YouTube, they have competitors such as Twitch, Kick, and many others. This is where they promote themselves and their brands and interact with their fans live and create content for them to then put on YouTube and TikTok. TikTok itself is proof that you can create social media for about anything and it can make you money. For example, for the past few months, I have always seen these ads for lighters and many other products. These products are sold by drop-shippers who make tons of money just by making ads for the lighters and getting them up for many others to see. There are tons of videos on YouTube that help you venture into the process of becoming like that. The world wide web has become huge for teaching people and is a place where you can really learn about anything and you learning for free still sometimes puts massive amounts of money into the teacher's pocket due to the monetization of videos. People also find jobs from social media nowadays with the use of LinkedIn of course, but there are also other ways too like Twitter. LinkedIn is directly used to help people interact with each other and find jobs, and it is part of some of the business that is done on social media. Social media also determines how social media approaches some situations and allow for direct feedback towards them. That means if their consumers are unhappy, they will for sure be let know fast and it will happen right under their verified accounts. That’s why support accounts exist on platforms to try to help with the UX of customers. Social media is so important today and it really affects the world in so many different ways. There are tons of people on social media and it is something that will not be forgotten about in the future. There is so much room for advertising, marketing, and much more on social media that it has now changed the way people think and interact with each other. The way that they display themselves has changed due to social media too, and it is now filled with a lot of people who are only showing when they are at their best which has created some problems with views of worth from other people.
